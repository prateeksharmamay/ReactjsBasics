1. Complete the configuration.
2. React Coding Starts from index.js
3. Create component in index.js that we want to be displayed in HTML page.
4. Then go to index.html page.
5. Create a hook where we want to render our component.
6. ReactJS doesn't necessarily create a SPA, we can tell where to render each component in our view.
    We do not have to control our view.
